## by Sofiyah Olaiwon


## Dataset - Ford GoBike System

- This document explores a dataset which includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area during the month of February. The dataset contains data of approxiamtely 180,000 rows and 16 columns documenting instances of bikes rented by ford over a period of months. The data contains information in columns encoded in numeric, object and categorical data types.

## Summary of Findings

- Most riders prefer to take short rides between 2 to 45 minutes while others spend hours.
- 75% of GoBike members are males, 23% are females and 2% belongs to other genders.
- A large percentage of GoBike members are subscribers while others are customers and although subscribers constitute more to the data, customers take longer rides on an average than subscribers.
- The distribution plots of both start and end station ids look similar meaning some stations are more frequented than others.
- The major areas in San Fransisco where the bike stations are located are San Jose, San Franscisco, Oakland and Berkerley.
- While we have riders with ages ranging from 20 to about 80, a large percentage of bikers fall into the age range of 25 - 45.
- Interstingly, no customers shared their bikes while on a trip. This may be due to the fact that maybe the bike sharing feature not being available to non-subscribers but since may be just a speculation as we dont have any information on this.
